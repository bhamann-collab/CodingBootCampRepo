GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
(Instead of the HTML document being structured with semantic elements, there are a number of div elements that have a class name with the appropriate semantic name, these class names consists of: header, footer)

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
(The title element description has been changed from 'website' to 'Horiseon'. This way, the title is more descriptive. Completed)
