# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

The changes that I have made to improve index.html and style.css are listed below:

*Some div elements in the index.html document have been changed to semantic elements. These semantic elements consists of: header, footer, main, aside and nav)

*None of the img elements had alt attributes. They have now been added to the index.html file

*To make the heading attributes in sequential order, we changed the H2 elements into H3 elements in the benefits class and the H3 elements into H2 elements for the service class. The reason for that is the the service class seems more significant than the benefits class in the webpage.

*The title element description has been changed from 'website' to 'Horiseon'. This way, the title is more descriptive.

*One of the img elements has a closing tag, this is now removed

*"Benefits h2" property has been changed to "Benefits h3" in style.css

*"Service h3" property has been changed to "Service h2" in style.css and in index.html
