Website contains my current portfolio with web development. Initially, A large portion of the code was css but I realised after messing around with bootstrap, it does not work well with lots of CSS. That HTML file is now called "index_old.html" and the css file still exists. I made another file with very little CSS just to primarily focus on bootstrap. It is now called 'index.html'.
